# Research-paper-Generator-Using-LLM
This AI agent generates structured academic research papers using the Gemini API. It gathers information from external sources (web etc.) and feeds it to the model to ensure high-quality content. The model is constrained to output a fixed JSON schema covering all standard sections, which is then compiled into a final text and saved to a PDF file.
